# Workshop Description

Welcome to the world of Big Data!

Every day, more than 370 millions of TB of data is generated in the world. Extracting value out of it requires us to understand all the different ways it can be stored and processed. This workshop is designed to help everyone, from curious learners to seasoned professionals, understand Big Data and the profound implications it has across industries.

Together, we will discover the complexities of Big Data, dive into its ecosystem, and get hands-on experience with tools like Apache Spark and its Python library. Our objective is to give you a solid overview of the Big Data landscape and delve into the use of one of its most important tools - Spark. We will also teach you how the latest AI tools can be used to improve your efficiency in processing data.

This workshop isn't just about learning—it's about truly experiencing the world of Big Data in a modern way. Join us for an enlightening journey!

This workshop will assume **very basic knowledge of programming in Python** for the few technical use-cases we will cover. Ability to use notebooks / Google Colab would help you get to work faster, but we will cover that briefly if you have never used it. No need to install anything else!

# Workshop Materials

## Pre-workshop Checklist

1. Please review this page to make sure you have everything you need for the workshop.
2. Register on Piazza by using the link we forwarded to you in a separate email.
